# Foenix help!

A help system for the Foenix F256 line of computers.

## Usage

After installation the program is accessed by typing '/help' from the SuperBASIC
prompt.

You are then presented with a simple meny from which various documents can be
accessed. Documents is selected by pressing the corresponding key next to the
document title. While pressing escape exits out to SuperBASIC.

Inside of a document, the up and down arrow keys are used for flipping between
pages. Pressing escape takes you back to the menu.


## Installation

Either build the tool youself (see section Building), or download a release from
the github release page (add link).


## Building

A few tools are required to be able to build and install the program.

For building we need the native GCC compiler, Make, Python and the 6502 compiler
suite CC65. You will also need FoenixMgr to be able to transfere the program
to your F256.
